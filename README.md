Wordle is a popular online word puzzle game where players have five attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback by highlighting letters in three possible colors:

Green: The letter is in the correct position.  
Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.  
Gray: The letter is not in the word.  

Players use these clues to refine their guesses and ultimately find the correct word. Wordle became widely popular for its simplicity and daily challenge format, where a new word is available to guess each day.
